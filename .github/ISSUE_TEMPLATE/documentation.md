**Add the affected command(s)**
Add the commands at the top of the message in \*\*bold\*\*.

**Add the change or fix**
Just saying that a command doc needs a change doesn't help at all, send what the change should be, or more easier; send what should be put into the documentation. (So, send something like "The documentation for the Purge command should be more detailed", or "The sentence `The user and reason arguments are the same as the Ban & Kick commands.` in the Ban & Kick docs should be changed to `Same as the Ban & Kick commands, there are also the user and reason arguments`"
