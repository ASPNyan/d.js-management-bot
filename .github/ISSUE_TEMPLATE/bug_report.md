**Provide the faulting code**
Send the code that is giving the error in a code block (Don't know how to use a code block? See [this](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) doc)

**Send the error log**
Don't send the whole log history, but send the error(s) in a seperate code block.

**Provide any fixes you have attempted**
This can help expedite the bug fix process.
